          <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the way that are brains are constantly changing, optimising themselves for the tasks they do the most. The neural pathways (collections of neurons that fire together) that are used often grow thicker, stronger and closer together, while neglected pathways are eventually 'pruned' away. This means that any new task, habit or thought can be difficult in the beginning, but with consistent practise those neural pathways will grow to be very strong and the action can be done with minimal effort. Because our brains aren't fixed, neither are our abilities - we are all able to change and improve, which is a very empowering thought.</p>
          <p>Personally, the principles of neuroplasticity are most powerful to me in terms of my thoughts. If I'm regularly stressed or anxious, then my brain is going to get really good at producing stress hormones and keeping my body in quite a tense state. However, if I consistently practise being calm, both through meditation and by just noticing my thoughts throughout the day and choosing not to get caught up in them, I can make the calm, happy neural pathways stronger, and that will be my default state.</p>
          <p>In order to improve your neuroplasticity...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Take care of your body and brain. Having plenty of sleep, exercise and nutritious food means you'll be able to grow or change your neural pathways faster.</li>
            <li>Attach the thing you want to improve on to something you already know. Tack a new habit onto something that's already a consistent part of your day (e.g. brushing your teeth), and always look for analogies or similarities between new learning ideas and information you understand well.</li>
            <li>Small but regular practise is so much more efficient than going all in once a month. Keeping the task simple and small makes it rather easy to do and to commit to daily, and gives your brain the time to grow those neural pathways so that information or habit can easily be accessed.</li>
            <li>Set clear goals and have a strong sense of purpose - you're motivated and focused when you have good reasons to be learning, which enhances your neuroplasticity.</li>
            <li>Having a growth mindset and optimising your neuroplasticity are closely linked - read on to learn more.</li>

          <p>A growth mindset is one that is aware of neuroplasticity - the mind's ability to grow and change - and therefore we approach new learning or any difficultly from the perspective that while we can't do 'x' yet, we can learn to. A fixed mindset would believe that our abilities are predetermined, and if we can't do something, we simply never will be able to, so we might as well give up. Meanwhile, the 'not yet' attitude of the growth mindset encourages us to ask questions and problem solve. Whenever we adopt a growth mindset, we strengthen the neural pathways of whatever we are learning, as well as this growth mindset pathway so that we will be more likely to take an open, curious attitude into the next problem we face.</p>
          <p>My school had a pretty big focus on the growth mindset in terms of our learning, and so the idea of approaching any learning problems with 'the power of yet' isn't new to me, though it is good to be reminded of. Personally it's more things like the fact that I have OCD, which I pretty much see as a fixed identity statement about myself. Taking more of a growth mindset into that area of my life would allow me to feel more in control and like I can learn better ways to manage anxiety. (In the meantime though, at least my room is spotless!)</p>
