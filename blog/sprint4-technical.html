            A time I got blocked on a simple problem
          </h3>
          <p>
            <!-- What was the problem? What problem solving techniques did you use? How did you feel throughout the process? What did you learn? -->
            I was working on the whereAreYou function in the JS Built-in Methods Kata, but whenever I tried to return the door Scooby had been found in I would get an error. I was still trying to get my head around exactly what each built-in method was returning, and had probably spent too long without a break trying to get to this point anyway. I tried googling around but with minimal luck, and talking through the code wasn't helping me either. I was getting frustrated because I just didn't understand what was going wrong.
          </p>           
          <p>
            In the end I looked at EDA's sample solution, and then realised I would first need to return if there was no Scooby found at all - only after that could I return which door he was hiding behind (the computer was trying to find a property of something that didn't exist whoops.) I had thought that the issue was something earlier in the code, but because I didn't understand the code enough to work through the logic myself, I couldn't figure out the problem on my own. I learned that I need to really take my time understanding a new method or piece of code that I put into my projects. If I just copy stuff in there without knowing exactly what it does or how it works, it's going to be really difficult to know how to fix any bugs when they arise.

            A time I solved a problem in an elegant way
          </h3>
          <p>
            <!-- What was the problem? What problem solving techniques did you use? How did you feel throughout the process? What did you learn? -->
            After working through the first 3 built-in method functions, I was beginning to understand how they worked, and how I could chain methods onto the end of each other rather than always assigning them to a new variable after each step. Working on the deBee function, I was able to reflect on those previous tasks and my improving understanding of them, and apply that to this new challenge. Through pseudocode I worked out that I needed to split my string into an array, filter out the word 'buzz' (in all forms of capitalisation) and then join that new array back up into a string. I first built the code by assigning it to new variables, because it made slightly more sense in my head that way, but once I got it working I went back and tried tacking each of those methods onto the end of one another and returning the whole thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt really proud when that worked - the code was quite a lot shorter and simpler, and I love that feeling of being able to say hey I can do this thing that I couldn't do even yesterday. Throughout the whole challenge I felt really curious and determined, and I was making sure I really understood each step in my code. I learned that taking your time, as well as taking regular breaks so that your mind is fresh, is really important when tackling a problem. I love to just get started on a problem but I'm learning that going slower and making sure I do things like pseudocode and really focus on understanding new pieces of code will save me heaps of time in the long run.

            A reflection on how confident I feel using the problem solving techniques and process
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - It feels to me a lot like when teachers tell you to show all your working in junior maths. You really can do it all in your head and just write out an answer. However, if you don't make a habit of it now, you're soon going to be doing calculus and massively regret it, because there's just no way you can store all of that information in your brain in one go. Right now I can see pretty much from the get go what code I want to write, because I'm just building one short function at a time. It seems like a bit of a hassle to write it out in plain English as well. Soon enough though, I know my projects are going to get way bigger and I won't be able to keep my plans in my head, both for my sake and for others, so I need to keep making sure I work on it!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trying Something</strong> - I'm pretty good with this, especially now that I do know how to do a few things and I can play around to try to make things work. I think I would be better at it if I were to be better at pseudocoding though - I think the two go hand in hand in trying to work through the problem with the things you already know and understand before you turn to other resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rubber Ducky Method</strong> - Mate I am great at this I don't even need a duck I just talk to myself all the time - I often need to hear something for it to make sense to me, so whenever I read things it tends to be aloud or at least at talking pace in my head. It's the same with talking through your code - you explain to yourself what is happening at each step, and bonus points if you can make puns and/or a cringy analogy along the way!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reading Error Messages</strong> - I'm slowly improving on this - it's pretty good at giving me an idea of what's happening, whether something is coming back undefined or if there's a syntax error. However often the line that the error registers at isn't actually the line that causes the problem, but where the computer picked up that there was a problem, so I'm working on using that as a base point to find the error in the code above. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Console.logging</strong> - Console.logging is super helpful, especially if I'm not entirely sure what a method will actually return. By console.logging at each step I can see how the data is being manipulated to work out what to do next.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Googling</strong> - I'm also getting better at this as I learn more. Trying to google a problem when you have no idea how anything fits together is really hard - it can be difficult to phrase your search well, and often any explanations refer to a bunch of other things you don't understand. Knowing more about what I want to achieve or why my code isn't working is meaning I can put better keywords in my searches, and each day my basic knowledge is growing so I can understand more of the explanations online.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asking peers for help</strong> - I've yet to do this for any issues with my code, but I've asked a couple of other questions in the foundations channel. I think when I get to the point that I'm stuck enough to need help then I will be confident to reach out. At the moment I have been able to work through any problems by myself, and I prefer to try nutting something out on my own first before asking others for help, because I think it helps me learn better.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - Again, I haven't had to do this yet - I imagine this will come in more a bit later when my problems are more complex, but I don't think I will have difficulty asking for help when I do need it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improving my process with reflection</strong> - I have grown to really like reflecting, both through the EDA reflections and my own each night. It's helping me to see how far I've come in just a few weeks, and taking the time to look at what I learned each day has been good to start the next day with those improvements in mind.
