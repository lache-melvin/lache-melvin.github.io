              I have learned how I need to do something myself to really learn it. At school I thought I was quite an aural learner, and I still am - I prefer to watch and hear than to read, and if I have to read I have a tendency to do it aloud... But I hadn't noticed how much actually doing the thing helps it to fall into place for me. If I look something up in advance I will have completely forgotten how it works when I get to it, but if I practise at the time then I usually remember, or just need to brush up on the details, rather than having to figure out what is happening all over again.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hadn't noticed the extent to which I had put value on being able to do something without looking it up - at school it was always praised if you could do a task without looking at your notes, and in exams you just had to know as much as possible. However, on this bootcamp and for the rest of my career, looking things up is how I'll have to work. I wasn't prepared for how uncomfortable that would make me, nor how much more confident I feel when I make a function on my own vs. this shallow win feeling I get when I have look it up. I'm getting better with it but I hadn't realised the effect it would have on me. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also learning how busy my mind is - I find it really hard to simply observe myself, I'm constantly analysing how I feel and then wanting to change those things and then judging the fact that I'm analysing and changing rather than just observing... It's challenging for me just to be, but I really want to get better at it because I see a lot of value the sense of groundedness that comes with it.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>
              Knowing your values is important in life because they define both our thoughts and actions. They help you to make (sometimes difficult) decisions and help you find your purpose. Having empathy is crucial for working in teams, both in learning and in work (as well as in life). If you can't relate to what another person is feeling, struggling with or just needs to know, it's pretty much impossible to work together effectively. And you need self-awareness in order to grow - recognising your weaknesses and mistakes means you can be aware of them and then actively work on them, so that you are always developing and improving.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
              I think the Listening and Looping challenges surprised me the most - I liked how they were a different take on the attention practice of meditation, and it was really eye opening to feel how strange it was to do. Though I sometimes notice points in conversation where I or the other person are thinking more about what we're going to say next than actually listening, I wasn't prepared for how weird it would feel not to respond. It was really refreshing and made me realise how much more engaging conversation can be when you are fully present for it.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
              I found reflecting on my values and identity the most difficult, as it was the main area of core that I hadn't spent much time thinking about before. I struggled because I feel that there are a lot of things that really matter to me and that I strive towards, and trying to pick just a few to define me was hard. That was when I realised that growth was a really big value of mine, and encompasses my want to improve in the other areas that matter to me (equality and advocacy, accountability, sustainability, being honest and authentic etc.)

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>
              The tech industry needs well-rounded people in the workforce, who can not only code but also interact well with team members and clients. Core teaches us some of the human skills that will make us better at those interactions, so we are better equipped to get jobs and have successful careers. Programming is also the kind of job where you can go down a rabbithole of working and working away at a huge project, and you could always do a little more before you leave for the night. Learning to be self-aware and grounded can prevent you from getting lost in that, and help you to step back from the feelings of imposter syndrome.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>
              I think the time spent studying Core during Foundations has been worth it - even the things that I did know are good to be reminded of regularly, like the importance of having a growth mindset. I know that both Bootcamp and probably my entire programming career will be challenging, and I am glad that Core has helped me find a self-aware and growth-focussed headspace before I get into it. I think if we had only been practising programming, I wouldn't feel as prepared for the challenges of Bootcamp, but with having the Core curriculum I feel both that I am in a good state of mind and that I know EDA cares about us as whole people, which is reassuring to know for if there are difficulties in any area of our lives during Bootcamp.

              <!-- What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind? -->
              I want to use the skills I gain at EDA to get into the tech industry - I feel that once I know enough to get a foot in the door, I am hardworking and curious enough to learn the rest along the way. I think EDA will equip me with those tools to continue to learn as well as how to interact well with people throughout my career. I know that I love constant change, so I'm keen to explore all the different facets of the industry. Other than that, I know I want to work on projects that make a difference (building sustainable technology, making programmes that help people with disabilities etc.) and I want to work in a positive and inclusive environment. And hopefully end up somewhere off the coast of Italy... or in Switzerland...

              <!-- Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp? -->
              When new ideas build on previous ones, it's easy to get totally lost if you didn't get that first idea - especially in a fast paced environment like Bootcamp - so I think that being a fast learner and having a brain that naturally loves logic will be a big strength of mine. I think my Sprint 2 analysis still stands - that being a perfectionist means I produce a high standard of work, but can get too caught up in the details. I've been trying - especially in these Sprint 5 game challenges - to just get the code working, and then go back and refactor afterwards. Though sometimes I will find myself trying to do it perfectly the first time, I'm getting better at not worrying about it until I go back later. However, I've been ahead of schedule throughout Foundations, so I've always had plently of time to go back and make those improvements. I think it could be a challenge for me, with the faster pace of Bootcamp, to have to leave projects in their 'first attempt' state.

              I think one of my biggest challenges will be that I'm moving away from home for the first time, so I'm going to have to figure out how to be an adult (hah) at the same time. While I'm excited about it, I know it's going to be a lot of change to get used to at one time, and so I'll have to allow myself space and time for that. I think it could also be strange for me to go from learning in an all girls school to working with a predominantly male cohort, as well as working with people of all different ages.

              I am able to communicate my ideas really articulately and concisely, but often if I'm excited or uncomfortable I can talk a lot without explaining much. Once someone looks at me like <em>what on Earth are you saying</em> I'll snap out of it and actually explain, but I want to get better at speaking mindfully, especially in circumstances like pair programming where clear communication is really important. I still also want to work on not taking on too much of the workload in a group situation - I can struggle to delegate because of being a perfectionist, but I know it's super important and that the only thing taking on too much will do is cause me heaps of stress... like this creey ass looming hand in the fog... let's not my dude.

              I will make sure to ask questions of the teachers and facilitators as needed, and keep track of any issues I have for the tech-ins to get the most out of those sessions. I will set clear goals for myself each day in order to stay on track, and make sure I spend time in the evenings or weekends going over anything I didn't understand so that I don't fall behind in future classes. I also expect myself to regularly go to the gym - coding is not exactly an active task and I don't cope very well with not moving, so in order to learn well and work well with others I will need to consistently get some form of exercise in, preferably in the mornings.
