        <div class="col-12">
          <p>I’m not sure exactly where I want to go long term, but I do know that I love to problem solve and to learn. I can’t see myself sticking to any one place in my career for too long - I want to try new things often, keep growing and meeting new people. In the next few years I want to travel as much as I can, and I think being a developer is great career for that as you can work from just about anywhere. I also know that I want to work in an environment with good people and on projects I care about.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <p>I would like to develop my negotiation and networking skills while at EDA, as well as my ability to delegate and trust in other team members. Being a perfectionist, I tend to take on way too much of the workload in group situation, but I am working on letting go of that because other people bring their own abilities, talents and perspectives and I know that as a team we can make things so much more cool and epic than if it were just me by myself.</p>

        <div class="col-10">
          <p>Some of my strengths are that I am a good communicator and am accountable and organised. Being a perfectionist is a bit of both - I am driven and committed to always complete work to a high standard, but I need to learn when to say 'good enough' and call it a day. I can also procrastinate a lot on things because I don't want to start until I know I can do it well. I want to work on pushing past that and learning as I go - I can never know everything there is to know before starting a project and there will always be bugs and mistakes, but that's ok! Even this pupster says so!</p>

          <p>I will block out times for when I study and when I don't, so that I'm not constantly feeling like I should be working. I am also making a commitment to keeping to the time-boxes as best as I can. I could spend hours making sure the fine details of my projects are perfect, but I have to keep the main goal in mind and get my work and the learning done - I can always come back and fix the small things later! I will also make sure to exercise regularly and take lots of small breaks so that my brain stays happy and fresh and I can be most efficient with my time.</p>

          <p>I will first consult the wonderful world of Google, to see if I can solve the problem on my own. If not then I will ask the rest of my cohort on Slack, possibly in the code-help-desk chat where there are more experienced previous students. I can also ask my facilitator for help if I need. I will make sure that I don't spend too long angsting over any particular problem - if no one can help at that time I will just take a break and/or move on.</p>

          <p>Currently I’m still working 30-40hrs per week, mostly in the weekends. Therefore, I am making sure my work for each sprint is completed as early in the week as possible. However, I have no other commitments while in Auckland for the Bootcamp, so will be able to give my full attention to the course then.</p>
