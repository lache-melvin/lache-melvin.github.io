        <div class="col-12">
          <p>Emotional Intelligence or EQ (emotional quotient) is about the ability to identify and manage your own emotions, as well as those of others. To have high emotional intelligence, you need to be self-aware and from that have the ability to self-regulate, while also needing social skills and empathy to interact with others effectively.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>While IQ assesses your academic ability, your EQ is about being aware of your emotions and how you control and express them. The other major part of EQ is your ability to empathise and connect with other people, which affects how good a leader or team player you can be. This is why EQ is considered as - if not more - important as IQ in a workplace.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <p>While someone with a high IQ might be able to complete a task well on their own, they will be incredibly difficult to work with if they don't also have good social skills. Unless you can understand yourself and others and communicate that well, it's hard to work well in a team environment. Furthermore, the soft skills of a high EQ become more and more in demand as you move into leadership positions later in your career. You can't be a good leader if you don't understand the needs of the people you are leading, or aren't approachable and trustworthy.</p>
