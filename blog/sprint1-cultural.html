          <p>During high school I was a competitive rower for 3 years. In my final year, my crew did really well - we won both the South Island Club Championships and South Island Secondary School Championships, and came 2nd at the Maadi Cup National Championships. My coach had high expectations for us the following season, but I was exhausted from the 30+ hours of training we had each week. I wanted have the time and energy to commit to other things in my life and keep growing as a person.</p>

          <p>I really value and desire constant learning and growth, and even though rowing was challenging, I was becoming tired of it being the same challenge. I felt I had learned what I could from the experience and was ready to move on. I also value authenticity, and wanted to do what was right for me, not what others necessarily wanted or expected. On the other hand, commitment and accountability are also core to my values, and I knew I would be letting my crew down by not racing with them for another season, as they would have to try and re-establish the rhythm and trust our crew had been building for years.</p>

          <p>In the end I chose to quit rowing, and I took on heaps of other challenges which was I’ve really enjoyed and benefited from. However, the rowing team didn’t place at Nationals, and I have felt guilty for the part that my leaving the squad and disrupting the crews had to play in that. In the end though, I think I made the right decision for myself in stepping out of the squad, as it has allowed be to broaden my sense of identity and try so many other awesome things.</p>

          <p>I have lived in Aotearoa all of my life, and the kiwi culture of constantly exploring in nature has also lead me to value the environment, and sustainability is a key factor in decisions I make. Being pākehā, my life has been a very privileged and sheltered one. However, as I’ve grown up, I’ve learned both that other parts of the world aren’t so lucky and that NZ isn’t as progressive as we might like to think it is. While it's much rarer to see extreme prejudice here than in many places overseas, covert discrimination is still everywhere. Open-mindedness and equality have become deeply important values to me, and I constantly work to unlearn and liberate myself and others from our ingrained prejudices and learn from everyones lived experiences. </p>

          <p>My strengths in terms of learning and career are that I am a fast learner and I am able to rationalise new concepts well by making analogies and comparing the new information with something I already understand. I can communicate well, explaining things clearly and articulately. (Well, sometimes - in other circumstances I will ramble - just shove a sock in my mouth I'll get over it eventually) I'm committed, determined and will always complete a task to the best of my ability. I also love problem solving - my brain is very methodical and I love the challenge every new problem brings.</p>

          <p>My main weakness in my learning is that I am a perfectionist. I tend to spend too long making sure the fine details are exactly as I wanted them to be, which I know will be a challenge for me in this course where we have so much to cover in such little time. I also can procrastinate things a lot because I don't want to start until I know I can complete it to a high standard.</p>

          <p>There is a yearly dance competition among the Nelson high schools, and this particular year there were 4 of us in my dance, and we were all choreographers (spoiler alert: bad idea). We eventually managed to agree on a song and vague idea for the dance but everyone’s vision was slightly different. We talked it over a few times and tried to form compromises but everyone was very stubborn in that what they wanted was best (i.e. disaster). We moved on and thinking it would be the easiest way to split it, everyone got a quarter of the dance to choreograph. I got the first part, but when I taught my section, one of the girls quit because she just couldn’t stand how different this dance was from her original idea (yes, I’m still slightly offended). We found someone else to take her place and we were down to 3 of use choreographing when… drama strikes again, just a week out from the show! Another girl pulled out because of the tension (cue the intense music as we try to teach the whole set to a new girl in the space of about 4 days).</p>

          <p>In conclusion, our strategies were not all that effective. We did try to communicate and compromise but we were all too headstrong in our own desires for the project. In the same situation now, I would probably just step down from the leadership role. I would have had fun just being in the dance, and with no one really willing to give up their own vision and work together, it would have been easier to just let them have it their way. I’ve learned that there is a time and a place for standing your ground, when you are really passionate about something or something bad might happen otherwise. However, sometimes I think its best to just let someone else take the reins. Not everyone in a group can be a leader, and I’ve learned to step back where I need to.</p>
